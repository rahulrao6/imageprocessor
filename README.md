ImageProcessingApp
Overview
ImageProcessingApp is a high-performance image processing software designed to provide an extensive suite of editing functionalities. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, ensuring a separation of concerns that promotes organized code and modular design. This software stands out for its dual-interface approach, offering both a command-line interface for automated scripts and a graphical user interface for interactive editing.

MVC Architecture
The application is structured around the MVC architecture, providing a systematic approach to organizing code into three core components: Model, View, and Controller.

Model (model package): The Model component is the heart of the application that handles data logic. It includes classes like Pixel and ImageImpl that encapsulate the properties of images and individual pixels. The ProcessingModelImpl serves as the primary data structure, storing images and executing image processing operations.

View (view package): The View component is responsible for the presentation layer. It displays images, menus, and histograms through classes like GUIView and Histogram. It uses Swing components to render the user interface, where users can interact with the images and observe real-time results of their actions.

Controller (controller package): The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and View. It listens to user input, manipulates data in the Model, and updates the View accordingly. Classes such as ImageController and GUIController contain logic to interpret user commands and trigger image transformations.

Functionality and Organization
The application offers a full spectrum of image editing operations encapsulated within the operations package, following the Command design pattern. Each operation, such as Blur, Brighten, or Sepia, implements the ImageOperationCommand interface, allowing for easy expansion and addition of new features.

Key Functionalities
Color Adjustments: Modify the RGB components or apply color filters to images.
Transformation Operations: Perform geometric transformations like flipping horizontally or vertically.
Filter Applications: Apply filters to images, including blur and sharpen for focus adjustments or greyscale for color reduction.
Histogram Generation: Analyze and visualize the color intensity distribution within images.
Class Organization
The Pixel class represents the atomic data structure for image data, encapsulating the color information.
ImageImpl extends the Image interface and maintains an array of Pixel objects, representing the structure of an image.
ProcessingModelImpl serves as a central repository for all image data and provides methods to perform operations on these images.
The GUIView class constructs the graphical interface elements, while the Histogram class renders the color distribution of images.
Why MVC?
The MVC design is chosen for its robustness and its ability to separate concerns, which enhances maintainability and scalability. It allows developers to:

Modify or extend the GUI without changing the underlying logic.
Add new operations or data models without affecting other components.
Maintain and debug specific areas of the application without wading through unrelated code.
Conclusion
ImageProcessingApp illustrates the effectiveness of MVC in creating a well-structured and user-centric image processing tool. Its architecture enables seamless integration of new features and adaptation to various user interactions, making it an exemplary model for complex software development.
